There are a bunch of different operators in programming. We will look
through arithmetical operators now.
#### ARITHMETICAL OPERATORS
JavaScript includes several standard
arithmetical operators (+, -, /, *) that you can use to do maths with your
numbers.

```javascript
var sumOfNumbers = 1 + 3;
alert(sumOfNumbers);
```

This will pop-up an alert box with the number 4.

TIP: Note how we didn't put 1 and 3 in quotes, because they are numbers.

#### COMPARISON OPERATORS

JavaScript's Comparison operators are used
to compare values(>, <, <=, =>, ==, !=). Most of them you know from math
classes in school, some of them can be new for you, so '==' is checking
equality, if two values are equal.
'!=' - Checks if they are not equal.

Alert : Don't mix up '=' and '==' as they have different meanings.

#### TASKS TO DO
1. Create 3 variables:
 * 1st variable named ten with value 10 inside
 * 2nd variable named three with value 3
 * 3rd variable named multipleOfNumbers that will be equal to 1st variable multiplied by the 2nd variable.
2. As a result, display the value of multipleOfNumbers.
