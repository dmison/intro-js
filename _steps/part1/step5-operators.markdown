All programming languages have constructs called *operators*. An operator is a character that represents an action, or sometimes a relationship. An operator affects whatever is in front of it in a particular way, according to the kind of operator it is, and according to whatever comes after it.

You're already familiar with operators from when you learned maths: `+` is an operator that represents the action of *addition*. When we use `+` in maths, we take whatever is in front of the `+` and add whatever comes after the `+` to it. Operators in programming work the same way.

There are lots of different kinds of operator. For example, you've already used the assignment operator, `=`, to assign a value to your variable in the last step. For this step, we're going to start with *arithmetical* operators, since you already understand how most of them work in the real world.

#### ARITHMETICAL OPERATORS

JavaScript includes several standard arithmetical operators (`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`) that you can use to do maths with your numbers.

```javascript
var sumOfNumbers = 1 + 3;
alert(sumOfNumbers);
```

This will pop-up an alert box with the number 4.

TIP: Because we're working with numbers here, we don't need quotes around our values, 1 and 3.

#### TASKS TO DO
1. Create 3 variables:
 * 1st variable named ten with value 10 inside
 * 2nd variable named three with value 3
 * 3rd variable named multipleOfNumbers that will be equal to 1st variable multiplied by the 2nd variable.
2. As a result, display the value of multipleOfNumbers.
