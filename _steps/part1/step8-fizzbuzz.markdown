Count from 1 to 50 and print the numbers out:

* If a number is a multiple of three, print 'Fizz'.
* If it's a multiple of 5, print 'Buzz'.
* If it's a multiple of 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'.
* For everything else, print the number itself.
P.S. You may wish to use arithmetic operator remainder (%):
It calculates the remainder when dividing.

10 % 3 = 1 — in 10 we have 3*3 + 1
16 % 4 = 0 — in 16 we have 4*4
19 % 4 = 3 — in 19 we have 4*4 + 3 etc
