We are going to be learning about JavaScript by using it in web pages.  This is the most common use of JavaScript.

To do that we will create a very simple webpage and use it to load up our Javascript in the browser.  

So what actually is a web page?

It's just a text file with two different types of content in it.

1. text content, ie the actual words that will be displayed
2. HTML tags, which tell the browser how the content is supposed to be displayed.

It's easier to demonstrate than explain, so lets create one.

1. **Create a folder for this workshop.**

    Make a folder somewhere on your computer and name it `intro-to-js` or whatever makes sense for you.  This folder can be on your desktop, or in My Documents, or where ever you want.  Just so long as you know where it is and it is somewhere that makes sense for you.  This folder is going to hold all the files that we create today.  

2. **Open that folder in Atom.**

    Open Atom.  Go to  `File` `->` `Add Project Folder`, browse to the folder that you created and click open.  You'll see the tree-view open on the left with `Project`, and then your empty folder.

3. **Create a new file called `index.html`**

    Right click on your folder and select `New File`.  When prompted for the path, type `index.html` and press enter.  You'll see this new file `index.html` appear both in the tree-view and also opened in a new editor tab.

4. **Add some HTML**

    Type or paste the following content into `index.html` and save it.
    
    ```html
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My first webpage</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Node Girls</h1>
        <p>Hi there!</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    ``` 
    
    Notice how both here in your editor the different parts of that content are coloured differently?  That's called **syntax highlighting**.  Many editors do this to make it easier for you to differentiate different elements in your code.

Ok so now we have a very simple webpage.  How do we see that in our web browser?  Just open a new browser tab and either open the file `index.html` or drag and drop it from your file manager.

## So what's HTML?

**HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the language that webpages are written in.  It's the stuff in a webpage that you don't see displayed which the browser uses to know how it is supposed to show everything else.  

Unlike a programming language, a markup language isn't a series of instructions but instead it is a way of describing something.  In the case of HTML it describes how content should be displayed in a web browser.

HTML is made up of what we call **tags**.  Tags are how we tell the browser what type of content something is in a page.

Lets look at the example above, specifically the line:

```html
<h1>Node Girls</h1>
```

The content here is the text `Node Girls` and it is *"marked-up"* with the `h1` tag.  By *marked-up* we mean that this piece of text is preceeded by an opening tag `<h1>` and following by the corresponding closing tag `</h1>`

`<h1>` is a Level 1 Header tag.

You can see these in the content above as the bits with `<` `>` around them.  Notice that there are actually two parts to each tag, an **opening tag** with `<` & `>`, and a **closing tag** with `</` and `>`

There are around 120 tags defined in the current version of HTML (version 5) but many of those are for very specific cases.

Lets look at the tags we used in the example above:

* `<html>` - 
* `<head>` - 
* `<title>` - 
* `<body>` - All of your content has to be contained within this tag.
* `<h1>` - Level 1 heading.  There are six levels of headings, `<h1>` through to `<h6>`.
* `<p>` - a paragraph
